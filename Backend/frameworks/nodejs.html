    <h1>Node.js</h1>
    <p>
      **Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that
      allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side, outside the
      browser, enabling the creation of fast and scalable network applications.
      Built on **Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine**, Node.js uses an
      **event-driven, non-blocking I/O model**, which makes it highly efficient
      and suitable for real-time applications like chat apps, APIs, and
      streaming services. Unlike traditional server-side environments that use
      multi-threading, Node.js operates on a **single-threaded event loop**,
      handling multiple connections concurrently with minimal overhead, which
      greatly improves performance for I/O-heavy tasks. It uses **npm (Node
      Package Manager)**, one of the largest ecosystems of open-source
      libraries, allowing developers to easily integrate packages and tools into
      their projects. Node.js is often used with popular frameworks like
      **Express.js** to streamline web application development and manage
      routing, middleware, and HTTP requests. Because it uses JavaScript on both
      the client and server sides, Node.js supports full-stack development with
      a unified language across the entire application. Its asynchronous
      programming model, built-in modules, and robust community support have
      made it a go-to choice for building modern, scalable, and high-performance
      web applications.
