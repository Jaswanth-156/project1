    <h1>DJANGO</h1>
    <p>
      **Django** is a high-level, open-source web framework written in Python
      that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design by following
      the **"batteries-included"** philosophy, meaning it comes with many
      built-in features needed for web development, such as user authentication,
      admin interface, database management, and URL routing. It follows the
      **Model-View-Template (MVT)** architectural pattern, which is similar to
      MVC, helping developers separate business logic, UI, and data models
      effectively. Django emphasizes **reusability**, **security**, and
      **scalability**, making it a popular choice for both simple websites and
      complex, high-traffic web applications. Its built-in ORM
      (Object-Relational Mapping) allows developers to interact with databases
      using Python code instead of SQL, streamlining database operations. Django
      also includes strong protection against common security threats like SQL
      injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery
      (CSRF). It has a rich ecosystem of third-party packages and an active
      community, which contributes to its continued evolution and support.
      Designed to help developers build web applications quickly and with
      minimal code, Django is well-suited for those who want to focus on writing
      the actual application instead of reinventing the wheel with every
      project.
