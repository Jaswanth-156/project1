    <h1>SPRING</h1>
    <p>
      **Spring Boot** is an open-source Java-based framework designed to
      simplify the development of stand-alone, production-grade Spring
      applications with minimal configuration. It is built on top of the
      traditional **Spring Framework** but streamlines the setup and development
      process by providing **auto-configuration**, **embedded servers** (like
      Tomcat or Jetty), and a wide range of **starter dependencies** that reduce
      boilerplate code and simplify dependency management. Spring Boot follows
      the principle of **"convention over configuration"**, meaning it provides
      sensible defaults for application setup while still allowing customization
      when needed. It is widely used for building **RESTful APIs**,
      **microservices**, and **enterprise-level applications**, thanks to its
      seamless integration with technologies like JPA (Java Persistence API),
      Spring Security, Spring Data, and more. The framework also includes
      powerful features like **actuator endpoints** for monitoring and
      management, built-in support for **externalized configuration**, and
      smooth integration with **cloud platforms** and **containers** like
      Docker. Spring Boot promotes modular and testable code using **inversion
      of control (IoC)** and **dependency injection**, making it easier to
      manage and scale applications over time. Its strong ecosystem,
      comprehensive documentation, and large community support have made Spring
      Boot one of the most popular choices for backend development in the Java
      ecosystem.
