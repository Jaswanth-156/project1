    <h1>Structured Query Language</h1>
    <p1
      >**Structured Query Language (SQL)** is a standardized programming
      language specifically designed for managing and manipulating **relational
      databases**. It allows users to perform a variety of operations on data
      stored in tables, including **retrieving**, **inserting**, **updating**,
      and **deleting** records, as well as defining and modifying the database
      schema itself. SQL is declarative, meaning users specify **what** they
      want to do with the data, and the database management system determines
      **how** to execute the request. The language is divided into several key
      components: **Data Query Language (DQL)** for reading data using commands
      like `SELECT`, **Data Definition Language (DDL)** for defining database
      structure using `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`, **Data Manipulation
      Language (DML)** for data changes using `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`,
      and **Data Control Language (DCL)** for controlling access with `GRANT`
      and `REVOKE`. SQL supports powerful features such as **joins**,
      **subqueries**, **aggregations**, **constraints**, and **transactions**,
      which ensure data consistency and integrity. It is used across various
      relational database systems like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Oracle**,
      **SQL Server**, and **SQLite**, with slight dialect differences among
      them. As the backbone of most traditional database systems, SQL remains a
      fundamental tool for data professionals, enabling effective storage,
      retrieval, and management of structured data.
